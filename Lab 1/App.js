//2 approaches how we can integrate it with JS

//1st internal JS in script tag - shows message with okay button

//2nd external JS 

//alert("this is 2nd time")

//another approach - would be displaced in inspect elements - no pop up message
console.log("hellow from console")

//alt+z for wrap text, ctrl+shift+i opens inspect
